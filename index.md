    From **November 2024** Apple are forcing Patreon to use their payment processor within the app. That means all Patreon purchases done through the iOS app are subject to Apple's 30% fee. **If you're an iOS user, I'd recommend purcahsing a membership via the Patreon website, not the iOS app.**

## Hi there üëãüèª

This page has exists to provide you with more information about **500 Social**, like why it exists, how it all works, and how we expect our members to behave on the platform.

So without further ado, let's get stuck in, shall we?

* [Why 500 Social Exists](#why)
* [Who can join](#who)
* [How it works](#how)
* [Member expectations](#expectations)

## Why 500 Social exists {#why}

500 Social is run by [Kev Quirk](https://kevquirk.com), I also co-admin another Mastodon instance, [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org).

Fosstodon has become a very large instance, sporting over 60,000 members across the world, and I miss the days of when it felt like a small community. So I decided to start 500 Social, which has 3 goals:

1. To be deliberately small, with a **maximum** of 500 members.
2. To be loosely tech focussed.
3. Require a paid membership of **$2/month** to ensure that the project is sustainable, but more importantly, to ensure members are invested in 500 Social.

## Who can join 500 social? {#who}

Anyone who can afford $2/month and is willing to abide by our [expectations](#expectations).

500 Social has a deliberately loose topic of "technology". So if you're interested in technology of any kind, you're welcome here. That could be anything that's tech or tech adjacent, like:

* Operating systems
* Mobile devices
* Development
* Tech news
* Blogging and online writing
* ...anything else you can think of

> Can I post about other stuff on 500 Social?

**OF COURSE!** We actually encourage it. We want "tech" to be the interest that underpins our member's interests, but it isn't what defines us.

We *want* you to post about your other interests, be it your family, your home, your pets, the art that you do in your spare time, your motorbikes, your cars, your tattoos, *anything* (a long as it abides by our [expectations](#expectations)).

## How it all works {#how}

So like we said earlier, there's a requirement for all members to pay $2/month for an account on 500 Social. If you decide you want to become a member, here's how it works:

1. You [sign up on Patreon](https://patreon.com/500Social) for $2/month
2. Once you've successfully signed up, you will receive and email from me with an invite link to join Mastodon
3. Use the link to choose a username then start enjoying the community

**Note:** If you cancel your subscription on Patreon, we will disable your account on Mastodon.

## Member expectations {#expectations}

I don't think we need a full Code of Conduct for 500 Social. So instead, I've decided to simply write some ground rules here that everyone is expected to follow. In the future, if I feel the need the need to write a full CoC, I will, but we're all nice people here, right? I'm sure that won't be needed.

Ok, here's the expectations:

* Don't be a dick to other members
* Don't post about topics that are illegal
* No porn or adult content whatsoever
* Posts about politics and religion should be avoided, if you strongly feel the urge to post about these topics, please put them behind a Content Warning

I think that pretty much covers it for now. I'll add more if/when the need requires it.
